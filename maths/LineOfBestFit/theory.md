the line of best fit for any given list of coordinates should be the average slope of all combinations of 2 coords
A - (1,1)
B - (2,3)
C - (1,5)
etc...

calculate slope = rise over run for all combinations of points and average then together to get the line of best fit .
AB
AC
AD
AE
BC
BD
BE
CD
CE
DE

further averaging all of the points and using the slope can give you the slope intercept form.
